Huge regards to the Duino Coin, as a main inspiration for the idea of APLO. Aplo is built by one of the core developers of DuinoCoin YeahNotSewerSide after seeing how DuinoCoin's idea could be refined. The project was in a very long development since 2020 until 2024. The main idea for the new blockchain was to enable mining for everyone even people without powerful devices, but to make it trully decentralized, ungovernable and with a proper blockchain. And after long years of research, development, APLO IS FINALLY HERE!","valuesHeading":"Our Values","valuesIntro":"Aplo is more than just a technology. It’s an idea even a dream once. Some of the important guiding philosophies are listed below.","simplicityHeading":"Simplicity","simplicityText":"Aplo is built in a way to be fully compatible with EVM powered networks, which makes the process of integration very smooth and painless. Since everything that ethereum infrastructure can provide will also work on Aplo.","securityHeading":"Security","securityText":"Users must be able to trust Aplo with their transactions, without risk of error or attack. Aplo gives the full block reward to the miners, who are the most critical members of the network who provide this security.

Mining transactions/gas with low perfomance devices","emissionCurveHeading":"2 Tokens System","emissionCurveText":"In Aplo there are 2 tokens that power the system.
